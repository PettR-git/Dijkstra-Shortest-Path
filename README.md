# Dijkstra-Shortest-Path
Code I wrote to simulate dijkstra in fire evacuating system for school project. The idea is that nodes should be locating a fire with detectors and engage firemode while spreading message of fire to another nodes. Then they will colaboratively engage a LED animation with the help of Dijkstra (shortest path animation). For the real system I rewrote the algorithm to C/C++.
